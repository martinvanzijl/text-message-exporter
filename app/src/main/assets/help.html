<p><b>Getting Started</b></p>

<p>This app exports text messages to a file. To use it:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Optionally choose a contact to filter by.</li>
    <li>Optionally choose a start date and/or end date to filter by.</li>
    <li>Click "Export Text Messages".</li>
    <li>Open the phone's File Manager.</li>
    <li>Open the top left menu (three horizontal stripes).</li>
    <li>Select the "Phone Storage" item near the bottom.</li>
    <li>Navigate to "Documents/sms-exports". There should be a file called "export.txt".</li>
</ol>

<p>The file will have the text message details as per your chosen filters.</p>

<p>You can also click on the link at the top of the app to view the exported file.</p>

<p><b>Filters</b></p>

<p>By default, all text messages on the phone are exported. You can use the filters at the bottom of
    the page to export specific messages only.</p>

<p>To export messages to and from a specific contact only, click "Choose Contact", then
    select the contact to filter by. You can click the "Reset" button to the right to reset this
    filter.</p>

<p>To export messages from a specific date onwards, click "Choose Start Date". You can click the
    "Reset" button to the right to reset this filter.</p>

<p>To export messages only until a specific date, click "Choose End Date". You can click the
    "Reset" button to the right to reset this filter.</p>

<p><b>Export Options</b></p>

<p>The app will by default export a plain text (.txt) file. You can change the file type in the
    Settings screen. Click on "Choose exported file type", then choose the desired file type. The
    options are Text, XML or CSV.</p>

<p><b>Emailing the Exported File</b></p>

<p>To email the exported file as an attachment, click the button "Email Exported File". This
    will create a draft email message with the file attached. You simply have to add the recipient
    address and send it.</p>

<!--<p>You can choose which files to attach to the email (text, XML, and/or CSV) in the Settings screen.-->
<!--    Click on "Choose files to attach", then check the files to be attached to emails.</p>-->

<p><b>Previewing the Exported File</b></p>

<p>After you export text messages, you can view exported file by clicking the link above
    the button.</p>

<!--<p>By default, the app shows the text file. You can change this (e.g. to the XML file)-->
<!--    in the Settings screen. Click on "Choose file to preview", then select the file type.</p>-->

<p>NOTE: If you try to preview the CSV file, it may not work. In my own testing, the CSV file
    did not display at all.</p>

<p><b>Showing the Export Progress Bar</b></p>

<p>The app can optionally show a progress bar to indicate export progress. To show this, in the
    Settings screen, turn on the preference "Show progress bar for export".</p>
